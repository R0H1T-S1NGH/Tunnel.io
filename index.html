            Dear Mr. Singh,
                <br><br><br>
                    I understand this is taking some time, however, I have sought proper feedback from the concerned officials, which is awaited.
                <br><br><br>
                    I would surely respond to your concerns at the earliest.
                <br><br><br>
                    Regards,
                <br>

                Subject: Urgent Resolution Needed for Pending University Account Issues
<br><br><br>
Dear Mr. Harshvardhan Arora,
<br><br><br>
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention the ongoing issues related to my ward's university account and the subsequent challenges we are facing due to its prolonged inactivity.
<br><br><br>
It has been a year since this matter first arose, and despite our efforts to resolve it, the situation remains unresolved. It has been 40 days since we last visited your office to discuss the matter and 24 days since you mentioned a feedback response time. However, we are yet to see any progress in addressing the concerns we raised.
<br><br><br>
The crux of the issue lies in my ward's blocked university account (Amizone), which is having a cascading effect on various aspects of their academic journey. The repercussions are as follows:
<br><br><br>
1. *Delayed Access to Results and Fee Information*: The result for the previous semester was declared some time ago, but due to the account blockage, we are unable to access any information regarding the results or the associated fee details.
<br><br>
2. *Obstruction in Semester Registration*: The current semester is already underway, but my ward cannot proceed with the registration process due to the account issue. This is impeding their ability to attend classes and engage in coursework.
<br><br>
3. *Attendance and Academic Progress*: The blocked account is also hindering my ward's faculty from marking attendance. This situation is alarming, as their inability to attend classes and participate in coursework could jeopardize their academic progress and future exam eligibility.
<br><br><br>
Given the critical nature of these challenges, I urge you to take immediate action. If you are unable to resolve these issues promptly, I kindly request that you escalate the matter to the higher authorities within the university. Furthermore, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in arranging a meeting with these higher authorities to discuss our concerns directly and find a viable solution.
<br><br><br>
The impact of this prolonged issue is not only causing undue stress for my ward but also hampering their educational journey. I believe that a collaborative effort between us can lead to a resolution that benefits all parties involved.
<br><br><br>
I eagerly await your response and hope that we can swiftly address these pressing matters. Thank you for your attention to this issue.
<br><br><br>
Sincerely,
<br><br>
