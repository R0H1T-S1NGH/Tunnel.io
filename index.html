            <p>
                Dear Sir, 
<br><br><br>
I hope you are doing well. I am writing to follow up on the concerning
matter of my ward, Mr. Rohit Gandaas, which was discussed with you verbally
around 10 days ago. The issue pertains to the handling of Mr. Gandaas' case by
the university authorities.
<br><br><br>
 Allow me to provide some context. Due to being out of town, I requested
my ward to meet with you and explain his concerns. During the meeting, he only
shared the information that was already documented, without mentioning the
names of the authorities he interacted with.
<br><br><br>
To shed light on the pertinent individuals, I wish to bring to your attention the name
of "Mr. M.P. Aggarwal," who holds the position of Chief Finance and
Accounting Officer. The manner in which Mr. Aggarwal communicated with my ward
during their interactions has been distressing. I feel it is crucial to
highlight some of the alarming statements made by Mr. Aggarwal: 
<br>
• "We will spoil your degree, and none of us will be affected except you." 
<br>
• "If you want to take legal action, take it."
<br>
• "VC won't decide your admission, I will." (He even made a threatening remark,
saying "should I call the VC and tell him to terminate your admission? He will.") 
<br>
• "I won't unblock your amizone account; go wherever you were before or where you
want to take admission. I am not accepting your admission." (He also
threatened to erase the 5th-semester result from the records as if it never
existed.) 
And etc.
<br><br><br>
The rest of the issues have already been mentioned in the documents
submitted to you and conveyed verbally by my ward. To reiterate and highlight
the major points, The email communication that followed raised distressing
issues concerning fee structures, penalty decisions, account blockage, and
examination participation. Additionally, Mr. Rohit Gandaas was pressured into
writing an email expressing his willingness to change his program from B.Tech
CSE INTL to B.Tech CSE, with the possibility of paying international fees and a
hefty penalty. However, the university management has not provided clear
explanations for imposing a 2 lakh penalty on Mr. Rohit Gandaas, leading to
further questions and concerns. Even after paying the forced penalty of 2 lakh
rupees, which was presented as the only option to sit in the examination, my
ward's account remained blocked.
<br><br><br>
I urgently request your intervention in resolving this situation
promptly. It is crucial for the university to reconsider the imposed penalty
and provide a written response addressing all concerns. Furthermore, I kindly
request a thorough investigation into the conduct of the authorities involved
to prevent such unprofessional behavior in the future.
<br><br><br>
This case has been ongoing for a year now, and with the recent
declaration of my ward's results and the deadline for the 7th-semester fee
payment being 17th July, I implore you to address this matter on an urgent
basis.
<br><br><br>
The well-being of our students should be of utmost importance, and I
trust that you will take the necessary actions to uphold their rights and
address their concerns.
<br><br><br>
I eagerly await your immediate response and cooperation.
<br><br><br>
Sincerely,
            </p>

The remaining issues have already been mentioned in the documents submitted to you and conveyed verbally by my ward. Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that during all conversations with every authority, my ward spoke softly, calmly, and with proper respect. There was no display of disrespectful behavior, use of inappropriate words, or raising of tone by my ward or anyone from the family.
